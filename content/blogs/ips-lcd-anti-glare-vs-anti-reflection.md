When designing IPS displays for outdoor or high-light environments, two surface treatments are commonly considered: **Anti-Glare (AG)** and **Anti-Reflection (AR)**.  

We explore:
- How each treatment affects contrast and clarity  
- The trade-offs in cost, brightness, and color accuracy  
- Best practices for combining AG or AR with optical bonding  
- Real-world examples from industrial HMI and medical devices
